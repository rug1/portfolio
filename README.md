# My web portfolio

I have built my website using the [Gatsby quick start](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/) guide and deployed to gh-pages following [this](http://iolivia.me/posts/7-gatsby-deploy-github/) blog post.

So the `master` branch is the built code and the source code can be found on the [`master-source`](https://github.com/rug1/rug1.github.io/tree/master-source) branch.
