Onboarding and the cost of team debt</strong> - <a href=\"https://kateheddleston.com/blog/onboarding-and-the-cost-of-team-debt\">https://kateheddleston.com/blog/onboarding-and-the-cost-of-team-debt</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/heddle317\">Kate Heddleston</a> has written a lot about the idea of team debt and how to avoid accruing it.
