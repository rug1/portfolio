When that happens, you end up with information stuck in different products. Time is wasted copying data across and trying to keep everything in sync.</p>\n<p>At Personably, we believe everyone’s better off when they can bring together their favourite tools.  To that end, we’re excited to announce our Workable integration! It’s now quick and easy to integrate Workable with your Personably account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.personably.co/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-14-at-13.10.46.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2018-06-14-at-13.10.46\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://blog.personably.co/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-14-at-12.38.33.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2018-06-14-at-12.38.33\"></p>\n<p>Check out our guide to how the integration works <a href=\"https://resources.personably.co/integrations/how-to-integrate-workable-with-personably\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Once connected, any candidates who are moved to the “Hired” stage in Workable will be automatically added to Personably. We’ll copy over any information already in Workable, such as the role they’ve been hired for.</p>\n<p>Personably already integrates with some other ATSs and tools, but over the coming months we’ll be looking to add a lot more. If there’s any integration you’d particularly like to see us build, let us know!</p>\n","published_at":"2018-06-14T12:37:36.000+01:00","updated_at":"2018-06-14T13:15:41.000+01:00","feature_image":"https://blog.personably.co/content/images/2018/06/Desktop-HD-2.jpg","og_image":null,"twitter_image":null,"meta_title":"Personably now integrates with Workable","meta_description":"Personably now integrates with Workable, making it even easier to onboard your new hires.","tags":[{"id":"5b225144bdee4800bff9a871","slug":"product-updates"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Lewis Blackwood","twitter":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b225144bdee4800bff9a871","name":"Product updates","slug":"product-updates"},"authors":[{"id":"5b211e5ebdee4800bff9a86b","name":"Lewis Blackwood","slug":"lewis"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"personably-now-integrates-with-workable"}}
