When your new hire starts, we’ll work out the best times for their sessions based on when everyone involved is free, and then we’ll create events in their calendars. The sessions also show up on a separate onboarding group calendar, so you can get a quick overview of what's going on and make changes via Outlook if needed – we'll stay in sync with any changes you make there. We’ve made it easy for you to invite other people from your organisation to collaborate on your account, so they can create and edit sessions and roles.</p>\n<p>We're building the platform to help you create the strongest employee experience at scale, and automating onboarding tasks like scheduling is a big part of that. If there are any other integrations, automations or features you'd love to see us build, please let us know!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","published_at":"2018-11-15T15:16:48.000+00:00","updated_at":"2019-06-05T09:47:27.000+01:00","feature_image":"https://blog.personably.co/content/images/2018/11/office-365.jpg","og_image":null,"twitter_image":null,"meta_title":"Personably + Office 365: Automated onboarding sessions in Outlook","meta_description":"You can now connect your Office 365 account to Personably!
